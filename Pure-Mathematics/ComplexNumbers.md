The complex numbers are the next abstraction of numbers from the real numbers. They accommodate taking the square root of negative numbers. To do this they define $i=\sqrt{-1}$, called the imaginary number.

From this definition we generate the set of complex numbers, that is numbers of the form $x+iy$ for $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$, this set is denoted $\mathbb{C}$.

$x$ is called the real part of the complex number and $y$ is called the imaginary part.
For $z\in\mathbb{C}$, we denote its real part as $Re(z)$ and its imaginary part as $Im(x)$. 

We say two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real and imaginary parts are equal.

# Square Root of Complex Numbers

To find the square root of a number is equivalent to finding numbers that when squared give our number. We take the later perspective when it comes to finding square roots of complex numbers.

Suppose we have a $z\in\mathbb{C}$ where $z=x+iy$, then in order to find the square root of $z$ we need to find $z^{\prime}\in\mathbb{C}$ such that $(z^{\prime})^2=z$. We know $z^{\prime}=a+bi$ for some $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, so we have to solve the equation $(a+bi)^2=x+iy$. After equating real and imaginary parts we are left with the following system of simultaneous equations:
$$a^2-b^2=x$$
$$2ab = y$$

We can rearrange and solve for $a$ and $b$. Remember that $a$ and $b$ are real!

# Dividing Complex Numbers

It may not be entirely clear what dividing two complex numbers means when in the form $\frac{x+iy}{x^{\prime}+iy^{\prime}}$, but we do know what it means to divide by a real number. So what we can do is reformulate this division in terms of a suitable multiplication.
$$\frac{x+iy}{x^{\prime}+iy^{\prime}}=\frac{(x+iy)(x^{\prime}-iy^{\prime})}{(x^{\prime}+iy^{\prime})(x^{\prime}-iy^{\prime})}=\frac{(x+iy)(x^{\prime}-iy^{\prime})}{(x^{\prime})^2-(y^{\prime})^2}$$
We are now just dividing by a real number, which we are more familiar with.
